# CPT105<br/>Introduction to Programming in Java

This repository houses a selection of source code from the CPT105 module at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU).
Notice that while I try to keep the source code complete and up-to-date, it is not guaranteed.

## Repository Structure
- :file_folder: `2020` **Folder** <br/> 
Contains code from the 20/21 academic year, including a Java project related to image processing ( :file_folder: `coursework-3`) and a time-limited assessment ( :file_folder: `coursework 2.2`).

- :file_folder: `2024` **Folder** <br/>
  Will be updated with source code for assignments from the 24/25 academic year.
